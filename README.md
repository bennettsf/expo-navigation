### Assignment: Implementing Navigation with Expo Router 
In this assignment I was ablew to familiarize myself with expo-router. I also decided that my implementation would include using a Stack layout which provides ease of access to previous pages. Learning how to create dynamic routing for user profiles was really the only trouble I had, but other than that everything was straightforward.
